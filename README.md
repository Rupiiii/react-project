# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- A job listing site built using react. I hosted on Vercel, but I can't seem to run the backend on it, so there is some problem regarding displaying and deletion of jobs, but it works just fine on the local machine.
- To run this, download this file open using VS Code, type "npm run server" to make sure the server has started, then in another terminal(make sure it's opened in the root directory) run "npm run dev". Hope this helps.
